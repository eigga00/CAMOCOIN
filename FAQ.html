  <li> <a href="#"><strong>  What is Cryptocurrency?</strong></a>
 <ul>
   <li><a href = "#">  Cryptocurrency is a form of digital money.
   <br>
  “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.</a></li>

  <li> <a href="#"><strong> How does it work?</strong></a>
 <ul>
   <li><a href=""></a></li>
 </ul>
  </li>
 <br>
  <li> <a href="#"><strong>  Why use cryptocurrency?</strong></a>
 <ul>
   <li><a href="">  Cryptocurrency operates independently of a central bank, which means it doesn't rely on financial institutions to serve as a third party.</a></li>
 </ul>
  </li>
 <br>
  <li> <a href="#"><strong>   Is it better than other forms of money?</strong></a>
  <ul>
 <li><a href="#">Most other forms rely on a third party to oversee all transactions which isn’t efficient because it being a trust based model, it comes with weaknesses.</a></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
 <br>
  <li> <a href="#">  <strong>What are some weaknesses?</strong></a>
 <ul>
   <li><a href="#">Well the first is the impossibility of non-reversible transactions since all third party institutions have to mediate disputes which costs links to an increase in transaction costs that lead to the lack of possibility for small transactions.
 <h5>  “… limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions.”
   The possibility of reversal spread the need for trust, which is not ideal because it requires merchants to get personal info from their customers and fraud is considered unavoidable so it just becomes accepted
   Besides the fact that money is centralized it is also comes at an unlimited supply which means the government can print as much as they want which leads to inflation.
 </h5></a></li>
 </ul>
  </li>
 <br>
  <li> <a href="#"><strong>  What is it worth, what makes it money?</strong></a>
 <ul>
   <li><a href="#">  Everything is potentially worthless until given value by someone. Just like the money we use today coins are given worth by us. Before the widespread use of money people bartered or traded valuables like gold for goods and services. It wasn't until we decided to travel with gold wasn't efficient that we started using actual money. Governments decide how much bills would be worth and this worked because governments  assumed liability. Changing the blank of trust from trusting someTHING to trusting someONE
  Money=value=trust</a></li>
