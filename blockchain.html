<center><div class="blockchaininfop1">
  <p>In 1991, Blockchain, a chain of blocks that contain information and a digital ledger open to anyone, was created. Blockchain was originally intended to timestamp digital documents so one couldn’t tamper with them but went mostly unused until adapted in 2008 in the creation of  bitcoin. Once data becomes recorded inside a blockchain it becomes very difficult to change it. The data contained in each block is the hash of that block and the hash of the previous block. The data stored inside the block depends on the type of blockchain. The bitcoin blockchain stores details about transactions such as sender, receiver and amount of coins.</p></div>
<center><div class="blockchaininfop2">
  <p>Every block has a hash which identifies a block and all of its content which is unique like a fingerprint. Once a block is created, a hash is calculated, and when something inside the block is changed, the hash will completely change. Hashes are very useful when you want to detect changes to the block. If the hash of the block changes, it's no longer the same block. The third element inside each block is the hash of the previous block, this makes a chain of block and is what makes a block chain so secure. The first block is called the genesis block. If you tamper with a block it causes the hash of the block to change, making all the following blocks invalid, because they no longer store a valid hash of the previous block.
</p></div></center>
<center><div class="blockchaininfop3">
  <p>Using hashes is not enough to prevent tampering because if you can change one block you can effectively change the hashes of the other blocks. To mitigate this you need something called proof of work, which is a mechanism that slows down the creation of new blocks. In bitcoins case, it takes about ten minutes to calculate the required proof of work and create a new block in the chain. It makes it hard to tamper with because if you tamper with one block you’ll need to recalculate the proof of work for all the following blocks.</p></div><center>

  <center><div class="blockchaininfop4">
    <p>Another way the blockchains secure themselves is by being distributed instead of  using a central entity to manage the chain. Blockchains use a peer to peer network that allows everyone to join. When someone joins the network, they get a full copy of the blockchain. The node can use this to verify that everything is still in order. When someone creates a new block it is sent to everyone in the network, each node then verifies the block to make sure it hasn't been tampered with, if everything works out each node adds this to their own blockchain.All the nodes in this network create consensus they agree on what block are valid or not. Block that are tampered with will be rejected by other nodes in the network.</p> </div></center>
