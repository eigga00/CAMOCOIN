  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <div class="box1"> <strong><p> What is Cryptocurrency?</strong><p>
    <p>A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.</p></div>

      <div class="box2"><p><strong>  Why use cryptocurrency?</strong></p>
    <p> Cryptocurrency operates independently of a central bank, which means it doesn't rely on financial institutions to serve as a third party.</p></div>

      <div class="box3"><p><strong>What are some weaknesses?</strong></p>
    <p>Well the first is the impossibility of non-reversible transactions since all third party institutions have to mediate disputes which costs links to an increase in transaction costs that lead to the lack of possibility for small transactions.<p></div>

      <div class="box4"><p><strong>  What is it worth, what makes it money?</strong></p>
    <p> Everything is potentially worthless until given value by someone. Just like the money we use today coins are given worth by us. Before the widespread use of money people bartered or traded valuables like gold for goods and services. It wasn't until we decided to travel with gold wasn't efficient that we started using actual money. Governments decide how much bills would be worth and this worked because governments  assumed liability. Changing the blank of trust from trusting someTHING to trusting someONE
   Money=value=trust</p></div>

    <div class="box8"><p><strong>Mining</strong></p>

    <p>A nonce is a number added to a hashed—or encrypted—block in a blockchain that, when rehashed, meets the difficulty level restrictions. The nonce is the number that blockchain miners are solving for.</p></div>

    <div class="box11"><p><strong>Public Key</strong></p>
